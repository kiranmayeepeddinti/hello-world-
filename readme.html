<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Implement all parts of this assignment within the module2_assignment.rb file in the root directory of your solution. The grader will load this specific file from this location.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement a class called LineAnalyzer. The grader will look for a class with this exact name.</p></li>
<li>Implement the following read-only attributes in the LineAnalyzer class. The grader will look for accessor methods with these exact names.
<ul>
<li>highest_wf_count - a number with maximum number of occurrences for a single word (calculated)</li>
<li>highest_wf_words - an array of words with the maximum number of occurrences (calculated)</li>
<li>content - the string analyzed (provided)</li>
<li>line_number - the line number analyzed (provided)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add the following methods in the LineAnalyzer class. The grader will look for methods with these exact names.
<ul>
<li>initialize() - taking a line of text (content) and a line number</li>
<li>calculate_word_frequency() - calculates result and stores in attributes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the initialize() method to:
<ul>
<li>take in a line of text and line number</li>
<li>initialize the content and line_number attributes</li>
<li>call the calculate_word_frequency() method.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the calculate_word_frequency() method to:
<ul>
<li>calculate the maximum number of times a single word appears within provided content and store that in the highest_wf_count attribute.</li>
<li>identify the words that were used the maximum number of times and store that in the highest_wf_words attribute.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Implement a class called Solution. The grader will look for a class with this exact name.</p></li>
<li>Implement the following read-only attributes in the Solution class. The grader will look for accessor methods with these exact names.
<ul>
<li>analyzers - an array that will hold a LineAnalyzer for each line of the input text file</li>
<li>highest_count_across_lines - a number with the value of the highest frequency of a word</li>
<li>highest_count_words_across_lines - an array of LineAnalyzers with the words with the highest frequency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the following methods in the Solution class. The grader will look for methods with these exact names.
<ul>
<li>initialize() - initialize the array that will have analyzers for each line of the file</li>
<li>analyze_file() - processes 'test.txt' into an array of LineAnalyzers</li>
<li>calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() - determines which line(s) of text has the highest number of occurrence of a single word</li>
<li>print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() - prints the word(s) with the highest number of occurrences and its corresponding line number</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the initialize() method to:
<ul>
<li>initialize analyzers as an empty array</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the analyze_file() method to:
<ul>
<li>Read the 'test.txt' file in lines</li>
<li>Create an array of LineAnalyzers for each line in the file</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the calculate_line_with_highest_frequency() method to:
<ul>
<li>calculate the maximum value for highest_wf_count contained by the LineAnalyzer objects in the analyzers array and store this result in the highest_count_across_lines attribute.</li>
<li>identify the LineAnalyzer object(s) in the analyzers array that have the highest_wf_count equal to the highest_count_across_lines attribute value found in the previous step and store them in highest_count_words_across_lines attribute.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement the print_highest_word_frequency_across_lines() method to
<ul>
<li>print the result in the following format</li>
</ul>
<pre class="text"><code>The following words have the highest word frequency per line: 
[&quot;word1&quot;] (appears in line #)
[&quot;word2&quot;, &quot;word3&quot;] (appears in line #)</code></pre></li>
</ol>
